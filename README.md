## 💻 Projects and Internships

`Internship 1: (Finished FEB-MAR 2021)`

**Title: The SPARKS Foundation - GRIP**

Description: The challenge required the application of EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on several datasets from Kaggle that were connected to current circumstances, as well as prediction using Supervised ML and Unsupervised ML.


Tools used: Python(Added Libraries), Anaconda(Jupyter), Visual Studio Code 

Learning Outcome: My understanding of diverse datasets, as well as how to extract relevant information from them, has vastly improved. Was a team player who provided crucial knowledge when it was needed.
Learned how to code and represent the data collected through the means in a neat and orderly manner.


`Project 1: (Finished-5th Sem)`

 **Title: Stock Management**

Description: The Stock Management System that we worked on was designed to scrape data from the stock exchange websites and do analysis on the changing stock values, thereby presenting the subscribed user with the necessary information.

Tools used: Python(Pandas, Beautiful soup), Anaconda-Jupyter Notebook/Visual Studio Code

Learning Outcome: I learned more about web scraping and how to gather data from a website in a clean manner also gathered more about the knowledge of the python libraries that were used in the program and ways to implement them in various scenarios.


`Project 2: (Finished-3th Sem)`

 **Title: 4-Link Robot-Arm**

Description: For large-scale production companies, the 4-link robot arm was designed in a two-way movement pattern to reduce human labour. The robot could move in a parallel (180 degree) motion from its base, and an arm was connected to pick up items weighing less than 250 grams. 

Tools used: MATLAB, Arduino UNO and Application, Electronic components

Learning Outcome: The following activity increased my understanding of how to use Arduino and MATLAB to test the functionality of various graphical movement patterns.

`Project 3: (Currently in works)`

**Title: Big Data Analytics for SSE**(Small scale Industries)

Description: Using Big Data Analytics to gain insight into the issues that SSEs faced during the lockdown.


Tools used: Python(Added Libraries) , SQL(Added Libraries of Python), Jupyter Notebook/Visual Studio Code

Learning Outcome: Learning more about Big Data and how to use it has helped me enhance my Python and SQL skills.

`Project 4: (Currently in works)`

**Title: Object detector and Path finder**(For the visually impaired)

Description: Using image recognition, we devised a method to detect items in the immediate environment and give a safe and quickest path for visually impaired people using distance vector methods. This image sensing camera will be put on top of a rover that is powered by a Raspberry Pi and connected to the Arduino that controls the detection camera.

Tools used: Raspberry pi(3B+), Arduino UNO , Electronic components

Learning Outcome: I learnt more about using the Raspberry Pi and enhanced my knowledge of using the Arduino. I also learned more about developing some components from scratch and the hardware implementation required to do this.

 Dear Sir/Madam,
 
I am a fourth-year B.E. (ECE) student who is new to the world of data science. Committed to assisting organisations in progressing through the implementation of strategic plans based on predictive modelling and findings. Interested in learning about new topics through solving challenges and gaining valuable insights.

Over the last few months, I've been working hard to develop the abilities necessary to become a data scientist. I've always aspired to be a workaholic in my field of interest, and this has helped me discover my strengths, which I plan to learn and apply more effectively through this opportunity.

I worked as a Data Scientist Trainee and Business Analyst, with weekly Project Based Tasks (4 Tasks) on generating insights from various sorts of real-world datasets within the company- 

> The SPARKS Foundation 

Over the course of 2 months(FEB-MAR 2021) through online mode.

The following is a snapshot of my broader technical skillset:

 + HTML/CSS 
    
+ C/C++

+ Python

+ SQL(MySQL)

It would be a pleasure for me to learn more about Ontum Education's requirements, and I would welcome the opportunity to expand my Python, Web-development, database management, and software stacks knowledge.

Thanking you for considering my candidancy for this position.


Sincerely,


Mubeen Afshan Khan R.
