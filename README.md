## 💻 Projects and Internships

`Internship 1: (Finished FEB-MAR 2021)`

**Title: The SPARKS Foundation - GRIP**

Description: The task included the use of prediction using Supervised ML and Unsupervised ML,EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) on
various datasets from Kaggle which were related to current scenarios.


Tools used: Python(Added Libraries), Anaconda(Jupyter), Visual Studio Code 

Learning Outcome: Greatly inproved my pre-existing knowledge of various datasets and also how to derive useful information through them. Was a team player providing necessary information at the time of need.
Learned how to cleanly code and represent the data that was obtained through the means.


`Project 1: (Finished-5th Sem)`

 **Title: Stock Management**

Description: The Stock management system that we worked on was aimed at obtaining data
   from the stock exchange by means of web scrapping and performing analaysis 
   on the changing values of stocks and hence providing the subscibed user with the required details.

Tools used: Python(Pandas, Beautiful soup), Anaconda-Jupyter Notebook/Visual Studio Code

Learning Outcome: Learned more about web-scraping and ways to extract data cleanly from a website.


`Project 2: (Finished-3th Sem)`

 **Title: 4-Link Robot-Arm**

Description: The 4-link robot arm was programmed in a two-way movement pattern for Large-scale manufacturing factories to reduce human labour.The robot could move from the base in a parallel manner(180 degrees) and an arm was attached to pick up stuff less than 250gms.  

Tools used: MATLAB, Arduino UNO and Application, Electronic components

Learning Outcome: The outcome of this above activty improved my knowlege on the usage of arduino and MATLAB for testing the working of certain graphical movement patterns.


`Project 3: (Currently in works)`

**Title: Big Data Analytics for SSE**(Small scale Industries)

Description: Using Big Data Analytics to derive insights about the problems faced by SSE's during
the lockdown.

Tools used: Python(Added Libraries) , SQL(Added Libraries of Python), Jupyter Notebook/Visual Studio Code

Learning Outcome: Learned more about Big Data and ways to implement it hence improved my
existing knowledge on Python and SQL.

`Project 4: (Currently in works)`

**Title: Object detector and Path finder**(For the visually impaired)

Description: Making the use of image recognition we came up with the idea to detect objects within the immediate enviornment and provide a safe as welll as the shortest path using distance vector algorithms for the visually impaired.
This image sensing camera will be mounted on top over a rover powered by a raspberry bi which is linked to the arduino controlling the camera used for detection. 


Tools used: Raspberry pi(3B+), Arduino UNO , Electronic components

Learning Outcome: Learned more about Big Data and ways to implement it hence improved my
existing knowledge on Python and SQL.

 Dear Sir/Madam,
 
I am a 4th-year B.E.(ECE) student, Beginner to the world of Data science. Committed to helping organisations to advance by implementing strategic plans based on predictive modeling and findings. Keen towards exploring new domains by engaging in solving problems and coming up with valuable insights.

Over few months, I've been relentlessly working on acquiring the skillset of becoming a Data-scientist.I have always strived to be a workaholic in my field of interest and this has enabled me to recognize my capabilities and I intend to learn and implement them in more effective ways through this opportunity.

I've worked as a Data-Science Trainee and Business Analyst having weekly Project Based Tasks(4 Tasks) on deriving insights from different types of real world datasets within the organisation- 

> The SPARKS Foundation 

Over the course of 2 months(FEB-MAR 2021) through online mode.

The following is a snapshot of my broader technical skillset:

 + HTML/CSS 
    
+ C/C++

+ Python

+ SQL(MySQL)

It would be a pleasure for me to learn more about Ontum Education's needs and I would welcome the chance to futher provide growth to my knowlege of Python, Web-development, Database management and learning more about Software stacks.

Thanking you for considering my candidancy for this position.


Sincerely,


Mubeen Afshan Khan R.
